# file_formatter

## Description 
This project is a file formatter build with python and converted into a binary. Nothing fancy it simply takes a standard file name and converts it to kebab-case_yyMMdd.

## Rational 
I like to have standardised filenames on my system. The format I like the most is kebab-case_yyMMdd. This is because it keeps names easy to read, removed capitals and spaces making things nicer on the command line. Also I like to have the date of creation at the end in this reduced format to give some additional context. Anyway, you download a file from work, friends, or just the random internet and all the names are confused. This binary ```toname``` makes it super easy to stay standardized and organized. 

## Usage 

Download the binary relase for mac and add in your urs/local/bin directory.

The ```roname``` command accepts one argument the file name.
