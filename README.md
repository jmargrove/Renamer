# Renamer

## Description

This project is a file formatter build with python and converted into a binary. Nothing fancy it simply takes a standard file name and converts it to kebab-case_yyMMdd.

## Rational

I like to have standardised filenames on my system. The format I like the most is kebab-case_yyMMdd. This is because it keeps names easy to read, removed capitals and spaces making things nicer on the command line. Moreover, I like to have the date of creation at the end in this reduced format to give some additional context. We all know the story. Recently download a file from work, friends, or just the random internet? Fed up with manually naming everything. Renamer is a cli tool that allows you to easily keep your filesystem standardised and yourself organised.

## Usage

Download the binary relase for mac and add in your urs/local/bin directory to get going.

The `renamer` command accepts one argument the file name.
